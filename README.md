# LowyerPOS
LowyerPOS is a mobile application that I developed for store owners to help them manage their inventory and sales. The app includes features for adding and organizing products, processing payments, generating receipts, and printing them on POS printers via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. With LawyerPOS, store owners can streamline their business operations and increase their efficiency and accuracy in tracking sales and inventory.
